Diarex is a diary program where you can add, remove, and delete events (with their dates). It has two modes: Text mode and GUI mode. Text mode can be opened by typing python3 diarex.py -t . GUI mode will open if program is executed without arguments, and also if -g is used.

There are no further instructions as the program explains all of its options in both modes when using them.

This program was tested on MX Linux (based on Debian 10 Buster). It should work with minimal issues on any operating system as it has almost no external library prerequisites. This program was developed and tested on python 3.7.3, but will most likely work on most 3.x python versions.

Libraries required:
regex(2022.10.31+, but will probably work with nearly any version.)
To install: pip install regex (pip3 if you are using linux)
