This project explores the data of bike share systems in
three major cities in the United States. The user can
choose which city to view stats for in the start.
Afterwards, the program will display some statistics for
the selected data (if it exists after filtering). Finally,
the user will have the option to view rows of data 5 rows
at a time if he/she would like to do so.

Note: While most of the code was written by me, the
project's layout (name of functions, order of functions
in the main function, and any multi-line comments) were
provided to me by the course I was taking.
