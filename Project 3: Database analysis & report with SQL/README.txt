This project a database which contains information about
artists' music, their genre, and financial information about
 who bought it including details about the customers.

The queries.txt file contais the five queries which were used
to analyse the data. The PDF file contains comments regarding
the results of these queries as well as a simple visulisation
to the the queries' results.

The PDF is made from a powerpoint template that was given to
me by a course I was taking. The database was also provided
by the same course.
